                <p class="p-ab">ILoveNorway.com is all about spreading Norwegian culture to those who are not aware of it. Norway is not only a beautiful country, but it also has amazing cuisine and dialect. I want to take a minute of your time to show it off.</p>

                <p class="cuisine">In order to get the full Norwegian experience, you must follow their traditional cuisine. Because of all the fjords (basically a river) in Norway, fish became one of the main sources of food. I want to give you a look into the locals favorite traditional dishes. The first dish is Fårikål which is Mutton and Cabbage. It is similar to a stew and usually eaten in fall and winter. The next dish is Kjøttkaker which is just meatballs. However it is not usually served with pasta, it is more commonly served with potatoes or stew. The next dish is not for everyone but it is Smalahove which is sheep head. It is exactly how it sounds, for the sake of everyone I am not providing a picture. Another traditional dish is Fiskeboller, which are fish balls. Commonly served with a béchamel sauce. To bring in a familiar yet still traditional dish is Vafler which are Waffles! Instead of hotdog buns, Norwegians will actually use waffles.</p>
                <p class="dialect">Norwegian is one of the easiest languages to learn for English Speakers. 90% of Norwegians actually speak English, but they really appreciate it when you try and use some of their phrases. I am going to teach you a few basic Norwegian phrases. If you want to say hello it is very similar to english, "Hei" or "Hallo". Good morning and Good Evening are "God Morgen" and "God Kveld". If you are introducing yourself, you can say Hi my name is... "Hei, jeg heter...". Thankyou is "Takk". Goodbye is "Ha det bra". Have a nice day is "Ha en fin dag". And how are you is "Hvordan har du det". Once you start practicing Norwegian it is actually every easy to learn. However, you will soon realize that many Norwegians really aren't chit-chatters so if you are just visiting you won't have a problem! </p>
